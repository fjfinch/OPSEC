# OPSEC
Personal repository for ma notesss. 

## Notes
Notes about pentesting. It is written for me to understand certain topics, not to explain it to others. Probably ignored important things, because I either really understand it, still have to write it, or ignored it and think it is not important.


## Tools
Added tools are submodules linked to their main git repository. They are included for me to be easily pulled (if they have no easy way to be installed via git/pip/gem). Credits to the writers and contributors for making awesome tooling.
