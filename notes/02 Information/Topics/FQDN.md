subdomain

hostnames **may** DNS domain, separated from the host-specific label by a period ("dot").
In the latter form, a hostname = domain name
domain name + TLD > hostname = FQDN
Hostnames that include DNS domains are often stored in the Domain Name System together with the IP addresses of the host they represent for the purpose of mapping the hostname to an address, or the reverse process. 

Individual Internet host computers use domain names as host identifiers, also called hostnames.
